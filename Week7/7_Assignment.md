This week's assigment is 

> make something big

I tried to make a simply CNC guitar.

Making a guitar is quite a complex work. I checked out a bunch of tutorials or videos:

### Design

I decided to use Fusion 360 for 3D modeling. There're some [detail discussions](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/design-validate-document/beginner-question-arch-top-guitar-model/td-p/5564290/highlight/true) in Autodesk user forum. [Inventables forum](https://discuss.inventables.com/search?q=guitar) also included some design and making tutorials. I found this video can be a nice starting guide for using Fusion 360 to creat a guitar body shape:

Then I started to draw my guitar based on these guides.

The body:

The neck:

I'll do these two main parts first.

### Make
The Shopbot isn't ready in our lab. So I'll update making notes later.
